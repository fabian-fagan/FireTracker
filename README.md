# FireTracker
*IN PROGRESS* 

Track active bushfires in Australia, NZ and the Pacific Islands using daily [NASA satellite data](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/). 
Created with Spring and utilizing the MVC design pattern, this webapp gathers current data from NASA and displays it in a more useful format, allowing for 
fires to be viewed on a map and calcuating location areas based on latitude and longitude while gathering totals for each country. The
data is automatically scheduled to fetch and update daily.
